# jsDecider

This project aims to help you making some decisions. Be it "TV or gaming", "pizza, chips or chocolate" or even "A, B, C or D" while you are on a well-known TV show.

Its core functionality is simple: have a list of things, pick a random element. But for those, hesitating over a dedicated decision, it's more than enough!


The project uses [Pure CSS](http://purecss.io/) for styling purposes.
